# "Predicting Alzheimer's Disease Using Deep Neuro-Functional Networks with Resting-State fMRI"

The scope of the current project is to reproduce the results presented in
*"Predicting Alzheimer's Disease Using Deep Neuro-Functional Networks with
Resting-State fMRI"* [^Sethuraman-2023] by Sethuraman et al. The aim of 
the authors was to predict Alzheimer's disease from resting-state fMRI.
